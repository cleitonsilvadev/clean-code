## 🎯 Core Philosophy & Principles

1. **Universal rules that hold in any project and stack:** Intent-revealing names, single-responsibility functions, context-rich error handling, and elimination of magic numbers.
2. **Precedence of repository conventions:** Local project rules (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `.editorconfig`, linters) **always take precedence**. The skill steps in where the repo is silent.
3. **Boy Scout Rule:** In legacy codebases, avoid massive out-of-scope refactoring — surgically improve the code surrounding what you are already touching.
4. **Discipline beyond the linter:** Cohesion, naming clarity, function size, and complexity containment depend on developer/agent discipline before declaring a task complete.

## 📋 Detailed Skill Contents

The skill instructs AI agents to strictly adhere to the following areas:

### 1. Flow Control & Readability
- <a id="rule-early-return"></a>[**Early Return**](reference.md#2-functions): Use early exits and guard clauses instead of nesting multiple levels of `if`/`else`.
- <a id="rule-room-to-breathe"></a>[**Room to Breathe**](reference.md#5-room-to-breathe-and-explicit-scopes) (Vertical Spacing): Blank lines before every `if`, after variable declarations, before `return`, and around loops.
- <a id="rule-guard-clauses"></a>[**Guard Clauses**](reference.md#5-room-to-breathe-and-explicit-scopes): Only a guard clause whose whole body is a single `return` or `throw` stays unbraced. Any block performing real work requires explicit braces.

### 2. Naming & Constants
- <a id="rule-descriptive-names"></a>[**Clear Intent**](reference.md#1-names-and-intent): Descriptive names stating what the variable holds or what the function does/returns, without needless abbreviations (`qty`, `tmp`, `val`, `data2`).
- <a id="rule-no-magic-numbers"></a>[**No Magic Numbers**](reference.md#3-constants-vs-magic-numbers): Extract numeric or literal values to named constants (e.g., `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`).
- <a id="rule-language-convention"></a>[**Language Convention**](reference.md#1-names-and-intent): Write code (identifiers, functions, types) in **English** by default, unless the project explicitly specifies another language; comments, documentation, and user-facing logs follow the pattern and tone established in the project.
- <a id="rule-valuable-comments"></a>[**Comments for the Non-Obvious**](reference.md#6-comments-only-when-non-obvious): Concise JSDoc/docstrings focusing on *why*, never narrating what the code visibly does.
- <a id="rule-no-boolean-flags"></a>[**No Boolean Flag Arguments**](reference.md#boolean-flag-arguments): Avoid passing literal boolean flags (`createUser(data, true)`). Split into two intent-revealing functions or accept an options object (`{ notify: true }`).

### 3. Immutability & Scope
- <a id="rule-immutable-by-default"></a>[**Immutable by Default**](reference.md#4-immutability--avoid-a-mutable-variable-decided-in-an-ifelse): Prefer `const`/`readonly` plus named pure functions over mutable variables (`let`) reassigned across conditional branches.
- [**Restricted Mutation**](reference.md#4-immutability--avoid-a-mutable-variable-decided-in-an-ifelse): `let` is reserved strictly when mutation is the essence of the algorithm (e.g., loop accumulators).
- <a id="rule-narrow-variable-scoping"></a>[**Narrow Variable Scoping**](reference.md#narrow-variable-scoping): Declare variables and constants immediately before their first usage, not hoisted prematurely to the top of a function.

### 4. Function Size & Complexity (SRP)
- <a id="rule-small-functions-srp"></a>[**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**](reference.md#2-functions): Each function must do one thing only.
- **Visual Size:** Functions should comfortably fit on a screen (~60 lines). Beyond that, they are doing too much.
- **Threshold Metrics:**
  - Maximum **≤ 4 parameters** (group into an object/interface beyond that).
  - Cyclomatic complexity **≤ 12**.
  - Nesting depth **≤ 3**.

### 5. Syntax & Clean Comparisons
- <a id="rule-strict-comparison"></a>[**Strict Comparison**](reference.md#7-readability-and-simplicity): Mandatory `===` / `!==` (in JS/TS) to prevent implicit type coercion bugs.
- <a id="rule-string-interpolation"></a>[**String Interpolation**](reference.md#7-readability-and-simplicity): Use template literals (e.g. `` `User ${id}` ``) instead of `+` concatenation.
- <a id="rule-no-else-after-return"></a>[**No Redundant Else**](reference.md#2-functions): Never write an `else` branch after a block that already terminated execution with `return` or `throw`.
- <a id="rule-no-nested-ternaries"></a>[**No Nested Ternaries**](reference.md#7-readability-and-simplicity): Nested ternaries impair readability; use guard clauses or dedicated helper functions.
- <a id="rule-no-type-escape-hatches"></a>[**No Type Escape Hatches**](reference.md#no-type-escape-hatches-any-ts-ignore): Avoid `any`, `@ts-ignore`, or blind type assertions. Use `unknown` with narrowing or schema validation.

### 6. Context-Rich Error Handling & Concurrency
- <a id="rule-errors-with-context"></a>[**Never Swallow Exceptions**](reference.md#9-error-handling): Capturing errors without proper handling or logging (`catch {}`) is strictly prohibited.
- [**Full Context**](reference.md#9-error-handling): Propagated or logged errors must include status, clear human-readable message, and original `cause`.
- <a id="rule-concurrent-io-batches"></a>[**Concurrent I/O & Chunked Batches**](reference.md#concurrent-io-and-chunked-batches): Avoid sequential `await` inside loops for independent calls. Run with `Promise.all()` for small bounded collections, or process in controlled chunks/batches for large volumes to protect socket and memory limits.

### 7. Architecture & Cohesion
- <a id="rule-layer-separation"></a>[**Decoupling**](reference.md#8-coupling-and-cohesion): Separate core business logic from infrastructure (database queries, HTTP controllers, view formatting).
- <a id="rule-real-dry"></a>[**Real DRY**](reference.md#8-coupling-and-cohesion): Merge code only when it changes **for the exact same reason**; do not artificially unify distinct logic that temporarily looks similar.
- <a id="rule-cqs"></a>[**Command Query Separation (CQS)**](reference.md#command-query-separation-cqs): A function should either perform an action (command) or return data (query), never both secretly. Functions with query names must not trigger hidden mutations.
- <a id="rule-parse-at-boundary"></a>[**Parse at the Boundary**](reference.md#parse-at-the-boundary-dont-validate-everywhere): Validate and shape untyped inputs at system boundaries (routes, queues, webhooks) using typed schemas (e.g. Zod), so core business logic receives guaranteed, strongly-typed data without defensive boilerplate.

### 8. React-Specific Guidelines
- <a id="rule-react-no-sync-effects"></a>[**Effects Do Not Sync State**](reference.md#10-react--an-effect-is-not-for-syncing-state): Never copy props into state inside `useEffect`. Reset with `key` or compute derived state during rendering.
- <a id="rule-react-effects-boundary"></a>[**Effects are for External Systems**](reference.md#10-react--an-effect-is-not-for-syncing-state): Reserve `useEffect` for networks, timers, DOM listeners, or polling.
- <a id="rule-react-complete-deps"></a>[**Complete Dependency Arrays**](reference.md#10-react--an-effect-is-not-for-syncing-state): Never omit dependencies; destructure stable hooks (`const { mutateAsync } = useX()`).
- <a id="rule-react-untouched-generated"></a>[**Untouched Generated Code**](reference.md#10-react--an-effect-is-not-for-syncing-state): Never manually alter vendored or generated code (e.g., `shadcn/ui`, Prisma clients, `dist/`).

### 9. Quality Gate & Discipline
- <a id="rule-quality-gate-discipline"></a>[**Active Diff Review**](reference.md#12-human-judgment-not-mechanizable): The author/agent must review diffs against this checklist before considering work finished.
- [**Repository Quality Gate**](reference.md#11-boy-scout-rule): Always run the repository's verification commands (`yarn lint:check`, `npm test`, `pytest`, `tsc`).
- **Never Bypass Linters:** Never disable lint rules to force CI green; fix the root cause.

## 🤖 How AI Agents Use This Skill

This skill complies with the Claude Code / OpenCode standard specification:

1. **Automatic Discovery:** `SKILL.md` contains YAML frontmatter with `name: clean-code` and semantic triggers.
2. **Autonomous Activation:** When asked to write, refactor, edit code, or submit PRs, the agent loads this skill proactively.
3. **Direct Invocation:** Users can enforce or request reviews directly (e.g., *"Review this file against the clean-code skill"*).
4. **Reference Guide Consultation:** For ambiguous patterns, agents consult real-world examples in `reference.md`.
